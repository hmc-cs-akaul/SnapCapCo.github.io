# SnapCap
## Project Vision
Our web-application adds emotional intelligence and creativity to the caption creation process. We trained a neural network on images of faces to detect emotion from photos. Then we built a program to analyze song metrics in order to classify lyrics into emotion categories. When a user uploads a photo, we use these two analyses to produce a lyric caption that matches their detected mood.
